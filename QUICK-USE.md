# Sales-i Address Plotter — Quick Use Guide

This tool turns a Sales-i CSV (spreadsheet) into map layers you can add to Google My Maps. You don’t need to install anything or use the command line.

## Before you start

**Create a map first.**  
Go to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/) and create a new map (or open one you already use). You’ll add your spreadsheet data to this map as a layer.

## How to use the tool

1. **Open the app**  
   Use the link your team gave you (e.g. `http://...:3000`).  
   If asked, enter the **shared secret** your team provided.

2. **Choose your CSV**  
   Click **Choose CSV** and pick the Sales-i spreadsheet (CSV file) you want to plot.

3. **Process the data**  
   Click **Process CSV (clean & geocode)**.  
   The tool will clean the addresses and look up their locations. This can take a minute or two.

4. **Check the results**  
   You’ll see a table and a map. Use the **Table** and **Map** tabs to review.  
   Fix any obvious issues in your spreadsheet and run again if needed.

5. **Add the layer to your map**  
   - Click **Add to Google My Maps (automated)**.  
   - If asked, pick the map you created earlier (or enter its map ID).  
   - The tool will add a new layer to that map with your plotted addresses.

6. **Done**  
   Open your map in Google My Maps to see and edit the new layer.
